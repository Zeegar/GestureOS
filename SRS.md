# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## Introduction

### Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the Gesture OS application. It will explain the purpose and features of the application, the interfaces of the application, what the application will do, and the constraints under which it must operate.

### Scope
Gesture OS is an experimental project that leverages movement and gestures to control basic OS functions on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Using the Ultraleap Motion Controller 2 and Ultraleap Hyperion software, this project aims to transform repetitive computer tasks into interactive, movement-based actions. The goal is to create a minimalistic, gesture-driven interface as an alternative to traditional inputs, engaging users in physical activity while performing tasks like email management, app navigation, and media control.

## Overall Description

### Product Perspective
Gesture OS is a standalone application that interacts with the Ultraleap Motion Controller 2 and Ultraleap Hyperion software to track and interpret user gestures. It provides a minimalistic interface for users to perform OS tasks through gestures.

### Product Functions
- **Physical Interaction**: Introduce light exercise through OS tasks.
- **Gesture-Based Efficiency**: Simplify routine actions with intuitive, hands-free gestures.
- **Minimalist Design**: Focus on uncluttered interaction.
- **Expandability**: Create a flexible foundation for additional gestures and functionality.

## System Features

### Minimalistic Main Interface
- Clean, essential task-related icons optimized for gesture interaction.

### Expandable Settings
- A collapsible settings area for gesture, sensitivity, and task configuration, accessible by both gesture and traditional inputs.

### Gesture Feedback
- Visual cues like trails or subtle color changes confirm gesture recognition.

### Flexible Task Integration
- Quick access to tasks like email, app shortcuts, and media control, with gesture customization options.

## External Interface Requirements

### User Interfaces
- The application will provide a minimalistic interface with task icons and settings accessible through gestures.

### Hardware Interfaces
- Ultraleap Motion Controller 2 for gesture tracking.

### Software Interfaces
- Ultraleap Hyperion software for high-accuracy gesture tracking.

### Communication Interfaces
- The application will communicate with the Ultraleap Motion Controller 2 and Ultraleap Hyperion software to receive gesture data.

## Nonfunctional Requirements

### Performance Requirements
- The application should respond to user gestures within 100 milliseconds to ensure a smooth user experience.

### Security Requirements
- The application should ensure that user data is not shared with third parties without user consent.

### Usability Requirements
- The application should be easy to use and understand, with clear visual feedback for gesture recognition.
